General
File names should be as short and specific as they can get. Each word is separated by an underscore, and each word starts with a capital letter.

Example: File_Naming_Conventions.txt


Art Files
Put a number and the end of the file name separated by an underscore. That will help us mark the current variation of that file.

Example: Colloseum_Concept_0.kra


Code
Structs - Each word starts with a capital letter, but is not separated by an underscore

Example: HelperCommand.cs

Interfaces - Interface name starts with the "I" letter, and it is followed by the naming conventions of a struct

Example: IAttackMethods.cs
